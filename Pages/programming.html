		<p>Winner of the COGS 300 robot tournament.</p>
		<p>
		Working in a team,
		I programmed a virtual robot to compete in a tournament against AI-controlled robots created by other students.

		<h2>The Name</h2>
		<p>
		In the late 1990s,
		Adam savage and Jamie Hyneman, best known for thier roles on Mythbusters,
		built a combat robot, Blendo, for the TV show BattleBots.
		Blendo was so effective that its design was banned from future competition.
		We named our robot after Blendo hoping to leave a similar legacy.
		</p>

		<h2>The Task</h2>
		<p>
		Our robot needed to collect green spheres and return them to its home base.
 		The robot with the most spheres after 2 minutes was deemed the winner.

		<br>
		<br>

		The robots had the ability to turn,
		move forward,
		and shoot lasers at their opponents, causing them to freeze and drop their spheres.

		<br>
		<br>

		In order to win, we needed to come up with a solution that handled both locomotion and strategy.
		We were allowed to use machine learning, an explicitly coded algorithm, or a combination of both.
		</p>

		<h2>The Solution</h2>
		<p>
		After countless hours of training using reinforcement learning,
		we realized that our problem was too complex for a purely AI solution.
		In the end, we decided to hard-code all of Blendo's behaviors with a strategy inspired by our initial attempts at machine learning.
		We observed that the most successful models collected balls until they possessed the majority,
		then they switched their focus to offense.
		<br>
		<br>
		here's a recording Blendo in action during the championship match of the tournament.

		<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
		<p>
		Some tasks are much better suited for machine learning than others.
