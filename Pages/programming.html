				<h2>Summary</h2>

				<p>
				Working in a group, I designed and
				programmed a virtual robot to compete in a tournament
				against robots created by my peers.
				</p>

				<h2>The Name</h2>
				<p>
				In the 1990s,
				Adam savage and Jamie Hyneman (who you probably know from Mythbusters)
				built a combat robot named Blendo for the TV show BattleBots.
				Blendo was so effective that its design was banned from competition.
				We named our robot after Blendo hoping to leave a similar legacy.
				</p>

				<h2>The Task</h2>
				<p>
				The robots needed to collect green spheres and return them to their home base.
				The robot with the most spheres after 2 minutes was the winner.
				<br>
				The robots had the ability to turn,
				move forward,
				and shoot lasers to stun their opponents.
				<br>
				We needed a solution that handled both locomotion and strategy.
				We were allowed to use machine learning, an explicitly coded algorithm, or a combination of both.
				</p>

				<h2>The Solution</h2>
				<p>
				After experimenting with reinforcement learning,
				we decided that a purely AI solution was not well suited for this problem.
				So, we hard-coded all of Blendo's behaviors with a strategy inspired by our best results.
				The most successful models collected spheres until they gained control over the majority,
				then they switched their focus to offense.
				<br>
				Here's a recording Blendo in action during the championship match of the tournament.
				</p>

				<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
				<p>
				If I could do it all over again, I would use reinforcment learning to handle
				Blendo's movement and a hard-coded algorithm for strategy.
